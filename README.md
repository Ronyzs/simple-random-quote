# Implementation Clean Architecture

This project is a simple Random Quote Generator. It allows users to fetch and display random quotes from [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/api).

## Dependencies

- **flutter_bloc:** State management library for Flutter applications.
- **equatable:** Provides value equality helpers for Dart.
- **dio:** A powerful Http client for Dart, which supports Interceptors, Global configuration, FormData, Request Cancellation, File downloading, Timeout, etc.
- **freezed_annotation:** A code generator for immutable classes that use constructor initializers and can generate copyWith, ==, hashCode, and toString methods.
- **json_annotation:** Defines annotations and code generation for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- **pretty_dio_logger:** A Dio interceptor that logs HTTP request and response data in a pretty format.
- **dartz:** Functional programming in Dart.
- **get_it:** A simple Service Locator for Dart and Flutter projects with some additional goodies highly inspired by Splat.
- **rxdart:** Rx for Dart. Power up your Dart streams with the rich combinators provided by rxdart.
- **bloc_concurrency:** A lightweight Dart and Flutter package for managing BLoC concurrency, inspired by redux-saga.
- **bloc_test:** A testing library for bloc that makes it easy to assert bloc states.

## Dev Dependencies

- **flutter_test:** Package for writing unit and integration tests for Flutter apps.
- **flutter_lints:** A set of recommended lints to encourage good coding practices in Flutter projects.
- **build_runner:** A build system for Dart code generation and running. It allows you to generate files using custom builders like json_serializable.
- **freezed:** A code generator for unions/pattern-matching/copy, inspired by Rust.
- **json_serializable:** Generate code for converting to and from JSON by annotating Dart classes.
- **mockito:** A Dart package for mocking. Mocks allow you to set up fake dependencies for testing.
- **mocktail:** A Dart package that provides a Mockito-like interface for Dart's built-in `test` package.
